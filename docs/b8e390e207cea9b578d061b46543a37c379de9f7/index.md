## Instructions for subgroup notetakers
If you are the assigned notetaker for your group, please take notes using whatever software you prefer (word, textfile, etc.), then save the document, and attach the file to the Slack channel #breakoutgroups by clicking the paperclip icon, navigate to the file, and click send. Although you can use the software of your choice, we suggest using the zoom "whiteboard" feature to take notes collaboratively with others in your group - see this video for instructions on how to use the whiteboard function and then save the whiteboard image to your computer: https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/breakout-sessions/how-to-use-a-whiteboard-in-a-breakout-room/
